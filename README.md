# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

As the world is getting modern and becoming dependent on machines. Machines are now used to identify handwritten or normal written texts so that they can extract information from them and then apply it in the real-life world. But if the machine detects some text but how will it identify which text or digit is what? Our project aims at training machines to identify different handwritten digits using artificial neural networks(ANN).
